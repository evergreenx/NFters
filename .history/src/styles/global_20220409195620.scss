.* About DM Sans DM Sans is a low-contrast geometric sans serif design,
intended for use at smaller text sizes. DM Sans supports a Latin Extended glyph set,
enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. It was designed by Colophon Foundry (UK),
that started from the Latin portion of ITF Poppins,
by Jonny Pinhorn. The DM Sans project was commissoned by Google from Colophon,
an international and award-winning type foundry based in London (UK) and Los Angeles (US) who publish and distribute high-quality retail and custom typefaces for analog and digital media. To contribute,

Jonny went on to design Karla for Google Fonts. Karla is a popular and quirky sans-serif typeface that supports both Latin and Tamil scripts. His continued fascination with India and Indian languages led him to ITF,
where he worked for three years. Jonny continues to work exclusively on Indic scripts—including Shrikhand and Atithi most recently.

Choosing type When you have some text,
how can you choose a typeface? Many people—professional designers included—go through an app’s font menu until we find one we like. But the aim of this module is to show that there are many considerations that can improve our type choices. By setting some useful constraints to aid our type selection,
we can also develop a critical eye for analyzing type along the way.
